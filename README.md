# 🐍 AI Serpentis

This project implements a Snake Game with both manual and AI gameplay modes. The AI learns to play the game using **Deep Q-Learning**, training over multiple iterations to improve its performance. Built with **Pygame** for visuals and **PyTorch** for the AI model.

> **Note**: This project is a fork of [`armin2080/Snake-Game-AI`](https://github.com/armin2080/Snake-Game-AI) with significant enhancements and extensions.

## 🎯 Game Logic

### 🐍 Classic Snake Game
- Control the snake to eat food and grow longer  
- Avoid colliding with yourself  
- The snake wraps around the screen edges  
- Score increases as you collect more food  

### 🧠 AI Logic
- **State Representation**: 11-dimensional vector including:
  - Danger detection (left, front, right, bottom)
  - Current movement direction
  - Food location relative to snake head
- **Action Selection**: One of `[Straight, Right Turn, Left Turn]`
- **Reward System**:
  - `+10` for eating food  
  - `-10` for collisions  
  - Small positive reward for moving toward food
- **Neural Network**:  
  `11 → 256 → 3` feedforward network with ReLU activations  

---

## 🎨 Customization Options

- **Snake Themes**:  
  Classic Green, Cool Blue, Fire, Royal Purple, Sky Blue, or Random  
- **Food Themes**:  
  Red Apple, Blueberry, Rainbow (dynamic), or Golden  
- **Background Themes**:  
  Light or Dark mode  
- **Debug Mode**:  
  Enables real-time AI debug information overlay

## 🚀 Running the Project

### Main Game
To start the game with both manual and AI modes:

```bash
python main.py
```

This launches the game interface where you can select your preferred mode and customization options.

### Training Mode
To train the AI from scratch or continue training:

```bash
python src/ai/agent.py
```

Training options:
- Training will save checkpoints to `data/checkpoints/` automatically
- Press `Esc` during training to save and exit
- Training visualization will be saved to `data/plots/`

You can adjust training parameters by modifying the constants in `agent.py`:
- `MAX_MEMORY`: Memory buffer size
- `BATCH_SIZE`: Sample size for learning
- `LR`: Learning rate
- `GAMMA`: Discount factor

## 📈 Results

After sufficient training (minimum of 200 cycles), the AI consistently achieves high scores by developing strategies to efficiently collect food while avoiding collisions.

Here is a sample graph after training for 200 Iterations:
